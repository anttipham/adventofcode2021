### coding advent of code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020)
views on languages
- c++ is a nice language
- haskell is beautiful but hard
- python is easy

i guess i should do harder (= more algorithmic) coding problems than these but meh might as well do this all the way to the end since i started

Notes:

Problem 16 skipped because it's really just a parsing problem, not an
algorithmic problem.

Problem 19 skipped because that is just a big programming project. I want to do problems, not projects.
