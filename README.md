## coding advent of code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021)
views on languages
- c++ is a nice language
- python is easy
- haskell is beautiful but hard
- javascript has method chaining, which is so cool

i guess i should do harder (= more algorithmic) coding problems than these but meh might as well do this all the way to the end since i started

Notes:

Day 16 skipped because it's really just about coding a parser. I'm solving algorithmic problems, not doing some parsers.

Day 19 skipped because that is a big programming project. I don't want to do a whole project in one day. (And I'm not sure if my mathematical knowledge is enough for it, although brute forcing does skip the mathematics :D)
