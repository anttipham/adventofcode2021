## coding advent of code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021)
views on languages
- c++ is a nice language
- python is easy
- haskell is beautiful but hard
- javascript has method chaining, which is so cool

i guess i should do harder (= more algorithmic) coding problems than these but meh might as well do this all the way to the end since i started

Notes:

Problem 16 skipped because it's really just about coding a parser. I'm solving algorithmic problems, not doing some parsers.

Problem 19 skipped because that is just a big programming project. I want to do problems, not projects.
